We describe this release process in order to give more predictability and transparency.
What was the goals:
* Shorten the release cycle
* Give more visibility to the developers
* Improve the experience of PrestaShop contributors
* Give time to the PrestaShop ecosystem to catch up with the new versions

### The Release process
With [Semver guide](http://http://build.prestashop.com/news/a-more-semantic-versioning-scheme/), PrestaShop want to manages its releases through a time-based model.
Each PrestaShop major release has two phases, development and maintenance.

### Development process
During this process all PrestaShop developments and stabilizations are done.
Where improvements and new feature will be introduced in PrestaShop Core.

### Maintenance process
Each PrestaShop major release is maintained for a fixed period of time:

* *Bug fix & security fix*: During this period of 2 year, all issues can be fixed.
* *Security fix*: During this period of 1 year, only security related issues can be fixed.

### Long time support versions
Since PrestaShop 1.4 version and every two years we release a new Long Term Support Version (LTS). Each LTS version is supported for a three year period for bug fixes and security related issue fixes.
